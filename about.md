## About Coddiwomple Blog
`Coddiwomple (v.): To travel in a purposeful manner towards a vague destination.`

Most of you know I love travel. While I've been lucky to hop on extended globetrotting excursions every few years, I have been wanting do it more frequently without breaking the bank. So I am taking full advantage of my job in software, which allows me to work remotely, and take it up a notch or five. Instead of working from my couch, why not work from couches around the world? Other than negotiating time-zones, where I am actually sitting at matters not thanks to technology. Thank you Al Gore! ðŸ˜„

The name **Coddiwomple** was suggested by a friend when learning about my plans. Even tho it may be some made up slang word, it seemed significantly more adequate than my oft used **Guasacaca** to name anything I don't know what name to give. Plus it just sounds fun! Gracias Adriana.

This blog is meant mostly for my own digital memory archive and techno-meditative outlet, but also to provide friends and family a glimpse into this new digital nomad adventure as it unfolds. I am not trying to gain followers, drive traffic, advertise products and services, or anything of the kind.

I cannot promise I will post very frequently, but I will do my best to write something up periodically. Posts will likely be brief with the occasional burst, so don't be expecting your next sweet procrastination destination. Maybe a couple of minutes of vicarious experience here and there. Adjust expectations accordingly.
