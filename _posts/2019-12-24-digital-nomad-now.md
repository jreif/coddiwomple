Well, I finally did it! I packed a carry-on-sized backpack and left behind my home of 18+ years to traverse the globe for an undetermined length of time. Why you ask? Because it is awesome and because I can. Don't be jelly. Ok, be a little jelly.

Just one week in, it doesn't quite feel too adventurous yet as I'm visiting familiar places and have not left the country. Spent my first week in Silicon Valley attending family events and crashing at friends'. Lovely time with everyone. However, dogs pose an unexpected challenge for working on the couch. It is a persistent battle for lap real estate. Unconstrained cuteness tho.

I would be remiss not to mention my fantasy football victory. Yay me! Flexing my earned bragging rights. Suck it Lucas and Ryan! Still love you. But I must admit the extra cash will come in handy to cover some travel expenses. Transpacific journeys will require coin.

Happy `favorite holiday` everyone!
