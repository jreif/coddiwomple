First trek into Sydney. I probably walked 4 hours straight right off the train. When I get into city-exploring mode I find it hard to stop wanting to just reach that next spot or see whats around that next corner, or where does this or that path take me to. I lose myself in the novel cityscape. Zig zagged downtown before looping around the iconic Sydney Opera House. Mandatory photos were taken. I was not aware the roofs are actually made of granite tiles. Bad ass. But to me, the best part was visiting the Royal Botanic Gardens right next door. Very sunny and hot day, but when you reach the windy spots, glorious! Eventually, the heat slowed me down and had to recharge at a crowded Starbucks. Tapping on the free wifi of course. I must say that in a way, downtown Sydney gives me a very Londonian vive.

I wasn't aware in Australia most shops and cafes close super early, around 4-5pm. There are a few reasons for it, but mainly due to different shopping habits and the high cost of labor. This of course makes it inconvenient for this digital nomad to find spots to sit and work or grab a snack/drink in the early evening. It is not 100% of them and there are still plenty of restaurants and other venues however; not a full shut out. But something to plan for and navigate.

Most of you probably do not know that I am a big fan of botanic gardens. I have a fascination with flowers which I regularly take photos of wherever I go. Streets, parks, golf courses, weddings, etc. You can imagine the kid-in-candy-shop effect botanic gardens can have. Anyhow, visiting these gardens in cities around the world is usually a joy for me. They offer a pretty, colorful, lively, and varied landscape to frolic in for a while. A nature oasis within the city's urban encasement displaying a myriad of elegantly curated and arranged plant varieties. Almost always puts me in a good mood. Music on my headphones, phone camera at the ready, and a grin on my face. Pure unadulterated Coddiwompling juice flowing through my veins. I'll spare you the full photo shoot portfolio, but gotta show you some. Expect plenty of flowers on upcoming posts when I hit other gardens at future destinations.

Some town/area names here are too much fun. Check these sequence of train stop names: _Waitara - Wahroonga - Warrawee - Turramurra_. "Next stop _Guasacaca_" would fit right in, wouldn't it? I also meandered around _Woollomooloo_ and on a later day around _Barangaroo_. You are totally repeating those names in your head and/or out loud right now, aren't you? And if you weren't, you are now. ðŸ˜†

Got a day that reached 43&deg;C (~109&deg;F). Opening the door of the house was akin to a dragon burping in your face, but less sulfury. You welcome the strong wind gusts against your sweaty skin. But then you think about the recent conflagrations and you get mixed feelings about it. There were actually new bushfires and flare ups in Canberra due to the high heat and gusty winds that day. Brutal.

Walked Hunter (family dog) around the neighborhood in between passing rains. Through the backwoods trail I couldn't help being hyper alert about spotting snakes and/or spiders. I am surely being unnecessarily overly cautious, but I am simultaneously mortified and fascinated by funnel web spiders. I just got here and don't want to die on my first walk through the bush. If you don't know about the Sydney Funnel Web spider, look it up... if you don't mind losing a night or two of sleep. Fluffy Hunter kept me safe. Good boy!

Early morning surf day! Early morning **sucking** at surfing. Early morning defeated retreat off the water. I need to do this surfing thing way more often if I am to claim even a basal degree of surf skills. Once every 3-4 years is evidently not enough and I refuse to not be at least minimally proficient. I am left with lightly bruised ego (for half a day) and sore ribs (for several days).

Australia Day is upon us. It is this country's somewhat, but not quite, analogue to the United States' 4th of July. Except it is more (understandably) controversial in a Columbus Day kinda way (look it up). I also get a bit of a bad taste when nationalistic celebrations insist on displaying military might (pretty much everywhere). Why can't we all celebrate our great countries without the stark reminder of how we can very efficiently destroy each other? I must admit, however, that I do have a life-long fascination with fighter jets and it is super cool to watch them fly nearby. Anyhow... took a day trip with the family to town to partake in the events and celebrations battling the castigating summer sun and heat. Everyone was out and about and, altho I dislike the crowds, there is a pleasant festive feeling in the air of a growlingly diverse society enjoying a summer day in the city.

Beach day with my host family. Another day to suck at surfing. And suck I did. Marginally better than last time but still not up to snuff. Yet I totally killed it at making a bunch of sand balls on the shore. So there's that. I also managed to get a sunburn on my hands, and my hands only. Probably because of my extended sand ball making session. Now I have to wear a long sleeve shirt in the heat so I don't look like an aircraft marshaller walking the streets.

Walked some more parts of the city. Getting my daily step average up! Is my gut any smaller yet? Can't tell. More beach/walking plans tomorrow in between work sessions and maybe meet up with a new couchsurfer. SO many beaches around here! Booked flight to Queenstown, New Zealand! Excited. Also kick ass plans for weekend getaway. Can't wait. Got some groceries to make Guasacaca. Avocados are in short supply, but still found some and gonna treat my peoples this week. Good times...
