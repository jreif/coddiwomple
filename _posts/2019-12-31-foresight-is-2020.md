A bit surprised by the very animated welcome in Facebook for this blog. I'm unsure I can live up to the expectations; but thanks for the sentiments! Just know this is going to be more of a brief recount of my experiences for posterity more than an entertaining literary excursion. Sure, now that I know more eyes are watching, I can try flex the creative muscles a bit here and there. But I'm afraid more often than not it may be a bit drab for most. ðŸ¥±

But here goes...

Last week I spent a few days by myself trying to get some work done in spite of the ongoing canine-computer lap-territorial conflicts. Got my fill of Venezuelan coffee and tequeÃ±os most days as well. Caught up a bit with one of my cousins. Decided to try my first ever depilatory experience. No, not the parts y'all thinking. Finally left Northern California after a very forgettable round of golf (altho great company) and a delayed flight.

Arrived in Southern California late night but still stayed up talking for quite a while. Got roped into beach volleyball in Santa Monica next morning. But to be honest, I offered very little resistance. And by very little, I mean none. Not a bad day on the sand after going 8-4 (well, 6-4 really as two games were low level trips and those shouldn't count). Note to self: find time to re-examine why I still live in wintery Boston. Self response: aren't you a nomad? You live nowhere and everywhere now dude. Note to self: ooooh right...

Visited Joshua Tree National Park after an uncommon snow covering. Pretty and serene sights. Unfortunately, many others had the same idea to come visit the park that day. The site was way more crowded than we'd like and the serenity sought suffered. So did available parking. Yet I'm happy we made the trip and witness little Olivia's first exposure to snow, her search for Olaf (of course), first snowball tosses, and shooting some sweet pics. Wrapped up the day with dinner and a musical session. Sometimes there are surprising mutual benefits of stretching your back on a foam roller with a two year old sitting on your chest. Enhanced pressure/stretch for your back and a new fun toddler ride.

Through my extensive traveling experiences, I can share the unsurprising insight that footwear choice is quite important. However, I keep (figuratively) shooting myself in the (literally) foot. Yes, choice paralysis is real and it got me again. I hope to correct this soon. Get the right gear for your feet, life is better that way.

I now find myself about to board my flight to Hawaii extending the last day of 2019 by fleeing time zones. I stare ahead at the realer start of my nomadic journey with a calm outlook and strong coddiwompliness. I anticipate countless new experiences and learning a lot in this coming year. Plus I like I get to kick it off in paradisiac fashion. I think it sets the right tone. As I travel westward, a song I love plays in my head. Most of you probably won't know it, but it is an awesome tune:

>
So I pack my bags and ride into the sunset <br>
I don't know where I'm gonna go but that don't matter at all <br>
I'm gonna do it my way and I don't change for no one <br>
Yeah, I'm living on the edge and I got nothing to lose

Well, my circumstances are not quite as dramatic as these lyrics, but that's how the song goes. I didn't write it. ðŸ™‚

Happy new year everyone!
