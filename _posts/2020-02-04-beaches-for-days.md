I'm noticing a small creep up in length of my posts. I expected the opposite to be taking place by now. I guess I am having fun writing this stuff up and totally encouraged by some you. Let's hope I can keep up with it. Altho I will try not to keep stretching my words too much.

Had a super nice day following the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk. I recommend it to anyone that comes visit around here. Lucky it was not quite as hot and had the pleasant company of a fellow couchsurfer. Sydney and Australia as a whole have a gazillion beaches! Through this walk alone we probably crossed about 8 beaches and bays. Extended the 2 hour walk into a 4 hour excursion including an ice cream stop and trekking past Coogee into Maroubra. Gorgeous sights. Long commute back home by bus/train. Sydney is growing on me. As nice as it is to be hosted, next time I may stay in the city to avoid burning so much time in transportation. But the long rides have allwoed me to see extended areas around the city and its been nice in it's own way.

Guasacaca success! Everyone seemed to like it. I mean, did you ever doubt it really? Come on now...

Early departure for weekend trip to, you got it, more beaches further south. Kinda eats a bit on my work hours, but this is the kind of trip I may have not made on my own, so gotta take advantage of the opportunity. Stopped by aviation museum on the way down. Flying machines are cool. And wow, the beaches down here are awesome. So beautiful. So many. Super long stretches of sand and welcoming waters, some with very few people. Some others are more popular and crowded but still enjoyable. Shade sources are scarce so bring your own and plenty of sunscreen. Something about walking on a near empty beach before sunset is delightfully peaceful and relaxing. Not that epiphanic I know. But it must be said if just to set the mood of my typed words.

My surfing ineptitude has no bounds. I have scraped my arm just getting ON the damn board this time. Also had a close call with a fin almost slicing me on the ribs because I can't even fall off gracefully (yet). Plus now I managed to get a sunburn on just my back this time. Argh!

On our way back we got to see some kangaroos prancing/grazing on a golf course at dawn. Got fairly close but they got scared off when I tried to get all up in their business. Would be nice to have newer phone with better low light camera. We then had a quick stop at vineyard to pickup a very tasty and elegant looking bottle of wine described as: _"This port style wine is smooth & sweet with lingering flavours of Christmas Cake in Italian glass ship captainâ€™s decanter."_. Totally up my alley. Long drive home with passing rains followed by long night chat with my homie. Good times.

What is this _Superbowl_ you speak of?

Loving me some Australia y'all. And all I keep hearing from every single person I talk to about it is that New Zealand is even better. Coddiwompliness bubbling in my blood tubes. Who knows how long I am gonna be down there...

I gotta give HUGE thanks to my family down under. I have had the most delightful time with them and just super grateful the care and attention I have received while here. Just went to the local mall to get them some little gifts in between work bouts. Hope they like them.

Folks, digital nomading does require significant self discipline in not taking off to explore every day nor getting sucked behind the screen excessively. It is a learning experience to find the right balance with ever changing environments and dynamics. I'm still figuring things out. While far from having an optimized system, so far so good.

What an eventful month. Kiwiland, here I come...
